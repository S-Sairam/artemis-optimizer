This repository contains the active research and development of **Artemis**, a novel optimization algorithm designed to unify the benefits of robust geometric optimization with principled Bayesian inference.

## Abstract

The pursuit of model generalization is dominated by two paradigms: geometric optimizers like Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which seek flat minima at a prohibitive computational cost, and post-hoc Bayesian methods, which provide uncertainty but do not guide the optimization process. We argue this separation is unprincipled. We introduce Artemis, a new class of optimizer that reframes gradient-based learning as a sequential Bayesian filtering problem. Artemis models the gradient as a noisy measurement of the true descent direction and employs a Kalman Filter to maintain a Gaussian belief over the optimal parameters. Our core contribution is a novel, Geometric Annealing Protocol: a dynamically-scheduled covariance parameter, κ, that allows the optimizer to adapt its own perceived geometry of the loss landscape. A high κ during early-stage exploration induces a wide posterior belief, guiding the search towards flat, robust regions. Annealing κ to a low value in later stages allows for rapid, precise convergence to a sharp Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate. We formally connect this adaptive smoothing mechanism to a form of variational inference with a dynamically changing prior. The central hypothesis is that Artemis will match the out-of-distribution generalization of SAM on challenging vision benchmarks while significantly reducing total training time.

## Motivation

Modern deep learning demands models that are not only accurate but also robust and capable of quantifying uncertainty. The failures of the [BCMEM](https://github.com/S-Sairam/bcmem) project (see review) highlighted that conceptual novelty without rigorous, large-scale validation is insufficient. Artemis is designed from the ground up to address these challenges by creating a single, efficient algorithm that targets robust, generalizable, and theoretically-grounded solutions.

## Core Idea & Mathematical Formulation (Work in Progress)

## Proposed Architecture & Implementation Plan

The `ArtemisOptimizer` class will be implemented in PyTorch, inheriting from `torch.optim.Optimizer`. The implementation will be thoroughly documented, including pseudocode and architectural diagrams to ensure clarity and reproducibility.

## Rigorous Experimental Validation Strategy

To avoid the pitfalls of prior work, Artemis will be evaluated with the following protocol:

1.  **Benchmarks:** CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
2.  **Baselines:** Performance will be strictly compared against AdamW and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM).
3.  **Metrics:**
    *   **Standard Accuracy:** Test accuracy on clean data, averaged over multiple runs with standard deviation reported.
    *   **Robustness:** Accuracy on corrupted datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10-C).
    *   **Computational Efficiency:** Wall-clock training time and memory footprint vs. baselines.

## Current Status

This project is under active development. The mathematical foundations are being refined, and the core PyTorch implementation is underway.
